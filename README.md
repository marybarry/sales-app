# Sales App

A simple sales pipeline application.

The project includes a React + TypeScript frontend and two AWS Lambda–based backend services (login + deals), backed by a database connection layer.

The application allows users to authenticate, view their sales deals, create/edit/delete deals, and manage deal status in a clean, intuitive UI.

## Setup Instructions

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm

## To run locally

- cd app
- npm install
- npm run dev

Go to http://localhost:5173/

Log in using test user:

    email: test@example.com
    password: password123

## A note on backend setup

The backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + PostgreSQL RDS) is already deployed and publicly accessible for the purpose of this task.
**You do NOT need to run the backend locally.**
The frontend is preconfigured to communicate with the live API endpoints.

I’ve included the deploy.sh scripts for review (with sensitive information removed). They aren’t required to run the project, but they show how the Lambdas were packaged and deployed.

For convenience, this project uses a single production backend.
In a real‑world setup, I would introduce a proper environment structure (local, dev, staging, prod) and allow developers to run the backend locally as well—for example, using Docker Compose to spin up Postgres and local Lambda emulation. This would make development safer, more flexible, and closer to production workflows.

## Features

### **Frontend**

- Login flow with context‑based authentication
- Dashboard displaying all deals
- Create, edit, and delete deals
- Modal‑based UI for editing and confirmations
- Deal completion toggle
- Responsive, clean UI built with Material UI + custom components
- API abstraction layer for backend communication
- Vitest + React Testing Library setup

### **Backend**

- AWS Lambda functions for:
  - **Login** (authentication)
  - **Deals** (CRUD operations)
- DB connection utilities
- Input validation and error handling
- Unit tests for deal logic

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite** (fast dev environment)
- **Material UI** (component library)
- **React Context** for authentication state
- **Vitest** for testing

### **Backend**

- **Node.js + TypeScript**
- **AWS Lambda** (serverless compute)
- **API Gateway** (HTTP interface)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **AWS IAM** for permissions

### **Infrastructure**

- Manual deploy scripts (`deploy.sh`) for each Lambda
- Zipped Lambda artifacts stored in repo
- Environment variables passed via AWS CLI

## Design Decisions

1. Serverless Backend

Pros:

- Minimal infrastructure
- Cheap and scalable
- Easy to deploy small functions

Tradeoffs:

- Cold starts (minor for small apps)
- Harder to debug locally

2. React + Vite Frontend

- Fast dev environment
- Component‑based architecture scales well

3. Manual Deploy Scripts

Pros:

- Transparent and easy to reason about
- No CI/CD complexity for a small project

Tradeoffs:

- Wouldn't be ideal for large teams
- Requires manual execution

## Validation & Edge Cases Considered

- Backend validates all required fields
- Frontend prevents empty submissions
- Delete actions require confirmation
- Auth state persists in context
- Empty deal lists are handled gracefully
- Toggling the 'complete' status UI updates immediately

## Testing

Frontend has component tests (App.test.tsx) using Vitest + React Testing Library.

Backend has unit tests for deals logic (deals.test.ts) and a mocked DB layer for isolation.

## Use of AI

I used Claude.ai chat and ChatGPT to:

- Generate boilerplate such as initial component scaffolding and test setup
- Generate template deploy scripts
- Refactor to replace native components with Material UI components
- Generate a template for this README that I could fill in myself
- Generate a SQL script, given the desired schema, to initialise the database

I designed the overall architecture and business logic, using my preferred tech stack.
I set up the backend infrastructure using a combination of the AWS Console and the AWS CLI.

## What I would do in future / given more time

### Frontend Architecture & Code Quality

- Extract data‑fetching logic from components into a dedicated hook (e.g., useDeals) and a service layer to improve separation of concerns and testability
- Create a shared MUI theme to reduce duplicated styling and centralise design decisions
- Add optimistic UI updates so interactions feel smoother
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, colour contrast)
- Add pre‑commit hooks to run linting, type‑checking, and tests automatically

### Features & UX Enhancements

- Add the ability to create a new user at login (currently using a test user)
- Add pagination, search, and filtering for deals (including API‑level pagination)
- Add tighter validation and edge‑case handling (e.g., max input lengths, preventing contract_end_date < contract_start_date, disabling submit during requests)

### Environment & Configuration

- Move the API base URLs into environment variables instead of hard‑coding them
- Introduce multiple environments (local, dev, staging, prod) with separate configuration and API endpoints

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- Add a CI/CD pipeline in GitHub to replace manual deploy scripts
- Integrate structured logging with CloudWatch
- Add caching (CloudFront or Redis/ElastiCache) for frequently accessed data
- Create a local development environment using Docker Compose (Postgres + local Lambda)
- Host the frontend (e.g., S3 + CloudFront) so the entire application is deployed end‑to‑end and accessible via a single public URL
